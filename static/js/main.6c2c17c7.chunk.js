For example, in Delhi, 2% of the value of the separated share of the property has to be paid as the stamp duty on a partition deed. The same rate is applicable on registration of partition deeds in Maharashtra, along with a 1% registration charge. (However, it is not mandatory for the co-owners to register the partition deed in the state.) The manner of calculation of stamp duty would be better explained through an example: Suppose a father, through partition, divides his estate worth Rs 5 crores into three parts, keeping 40% share with himself, while allocating 30% each to two of his sons. In this case, the stamp duty will be applicable on the 60% of the property value, i.e., Rs 3 crores.

After the will owner\u2019s demise, the executor named in the will applies for the testamentary proceedings in the civil court. They must apply for the same within two years from the death of the will owner. The executor must also submit a proof confirming will testator\u2019s death. They should also confirm that this the last will and it is a valid testament of the deceased. The court issues a notice to the testator\u2019s legal heirs to file objections if any to the granting of probate or citation publication in the local newspaper. The court also confirms if the will submitted is the actual final will of the deceased person. It also confirms whether the testator duly executed and attested the will according to the law. Also, it collects proof on whether the testator was of sound mind when they created a will. Finally, the court issues a letter of probate or a letter of administration, mentioning the necessary points are satisfied. One can challenge the will by claiming the testator was mentally unsound while making the will. Also can claim that the will was altered after being signed. During such times, a registered will helps the court by being a piece of legal evidence against these allegations. One cannot destroy, steal, mutilate or tamper with the registered will.
