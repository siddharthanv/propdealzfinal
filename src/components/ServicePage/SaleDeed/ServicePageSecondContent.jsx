          Things to keep in mind before executing a sale deed

          Before the execution of the sale deed, the buyer should ascertain that
          the title of the property is free of all encumbrances. Verification of
          the encumbrance status from the registrar's office is a must for the
          buyer purchasing the property. After ensuring that the property is
          free from encumbrances, the purchaser should also corroborate that all
          the statutory payments such as water/electricity bill, cess, property
          tax and maintenance charges have been cleared and no further dues or
          permission is pending for the transfer of property through a sale
          deed. Buyers of a property must take note that the sale deed is one of
          the most important documents which establishes the proof of ownership
          post the purchase is made. Hence, one must make it a point to acquire
          this document.
