          Over the years, there has been a surge in the number of
          tenant-landlord disputes arising due to several reasons. No
          landlord/tenant would ever like to get trapped in a legal situation.
          Thus, to avoid any unwanted legal situated in future, it is essential
          to get the rent agreement registered before entering into a rental
          situation. There is a high probability that if you get your rental
          agreement registered with the local registrar, you can easily avoid
          unwanted legal situations.
