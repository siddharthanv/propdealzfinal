          It denotes the right of the mortgagor to recover or redeem the
          property on payment of the loan amount. Since a mortgage involves the
          transfer of interest in immovable property from the mortgagor to the
          mortgagee, the interest has to be transferred back on repayment of the
          mortgage amount.
