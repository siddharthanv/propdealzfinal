          In 2018, Tamil Naduâ€™s Registration Department came up with the idea to
          phase out paper-based Pattas and introduce geo information system
          (GIS) based registration in which land would be marked using geo
          coordinates. The facility was added in an updated version of the
          Simplified and Transparent Administration of Registration (STAR 2.0).
          Apart from paperwork being reduced drastically, it addressed the
          problem of fake Pattas. In Tamil Nadu, fake Patta Chitta adangals have
          been a problem, with cases cropping up every now and then. The
          authorities are taking steps to prevent instances of use of fake
          Pattas. An aggrieved person can file a declaratory petition under
          Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act,1963 before the relevant court.
