        <p className="contentfinal">
          It is true that not registering a will doesn’t mean the will isn’t
          genuine. The unregistered will doesn’t stop any legal heir to fight
          for the same. Then why is it recommended to register a will? The
          government does not consider a will has the only final legal document
          for distributing any deceased person’s estate or other assets. After
          the will owner’s demise, the executor named in the will applies for
          the testamentary proceedings in the civil court. They must apply for
          the same within two years from the death of the will owner. The
          executor must also submit a proof confirming will testator’s death.
          They should also confirm that this the last will and it is a valid
          testament of the deceased. The court issues a notice to the testator’s
          legal heirs to file objections if any to the granting of probate or
          citation publication in the local newspaper. The court also confirms
          if the will submitted is the actual final will of the deceased person.
          It also confirms whether the testator duly executed and attested the
          will according to the law. Also, it collects proof on whether the
          testator was of sound mind when they created a will. Finally, the
          court issues a letter of probate or a letter of administration,
          mentioning the necessary points are satisfied. One can challenge the
          will by claiming the testator was mentally unsound while making the
          will. Also can claim that the will was altered after being signed.
          During such times, a registered will helps the court by being a piece
          of legal evidence against these allegations. One cannot destroy,
          steal, mutilate or tamper with the registered will. Hence, the court
          will not doubt the will’s authenticity. This helps the asset
          distribution process to move peacefully without chaos or confusion.
